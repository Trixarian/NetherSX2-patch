# NetherSX2-patch
These are companion scripts for NetherSX2 to expand on the amazing work already done by Anon and EZOnTheEyes

They aim to do the following:
* Remove the unnecessary ad services bloat left in the apk
* Fix the RetroAchievements Notifications
* Expose more Global settings in the App Settings to the user
* Update the GameDB, Controller Support, and the Widescreen and No-Interlace Patches
* Add additional AetherSX2/NetherSX2 spesific fixes to the GameDB
* Resign the APK to Remove the Play Protect Warning

## Installing NetherSX2
Once you've grabbed a copy of the [NetherSX2 APK](https://github.com/Trixarian/NetherSX2-patch/releases/download/2.1/NetherSX2-v2.1-4248.apk), it's time to install it on to your device

If you were using a copy of NetherSX2 1.9a or above: 
0. (Optional) Backup your files in case something goes wrong. The easiest method is to use the AetherSX2's built in Transfer Data function by using it's Export feature to move your files to an external folder. This will backup your bios files, memcards, save states, game settings, covers and texture packs
1. Install the apk normally to update to the latest version and keep your current settings

If you were using AetherSX2 or a copy of NetherSX2 older than 1.9a:
1. Backup your files. The easiest method is to use the AetherSX2's built in Transfer Data function by using it's Export feature to move your files to an external folder. This will backup your bios files, memcards, save states, game settings, covers and texture packs
2. After backing up your files, you need to remove any previous copies of AetherSX2 or NetherSX2. Do this by Uninstalling the app normally. Be sure NOT to keep any files if prompted
3. With the Backup and Uninstalls done, all that remains is to navigate to where you put your NetherSX2 apk with your File Manager (named Files or File Manager depending on your device) and tapping it to install it to your device
4. Once installed, run the app and configure it normally. Once at the Game List screen, you can access the Transfer Data/Backup Data feature and Import the files you exported earlier by navigating to the folder you put all your backed up files. This should import your bios files, memcards, save states, game settings, covers and texture packs
5. Now spend some time redoing the Global App Settings and you should be ready to go
